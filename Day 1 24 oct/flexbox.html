Flexbox is a powerful layout module in CSS that allows for the arrangement of elements within a container, providing flexibility and control over alignment, spacing, and distribution of items. Here are some key steps to implement Flexbox in your web design:

1. Set the display property of the container to "flex".
 2. Use flex-direction to define the direction of the flex items (row or column).
 3. Apply justify-content to align items along the main axis.
 4. Use align-items to align items along the cross axis.
 5. Utilize flex-wrap to control item wrapping within the container.
